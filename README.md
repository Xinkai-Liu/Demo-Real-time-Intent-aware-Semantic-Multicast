# Demo: Real-time-Generative-Multicasting-with-On-Device-Intent-aware-Semantic-Decomposition
<div align="center">

üé¨ **Video Demo**  
This is the real-time video demo for Generative Multicasting with On-Device Intent-aware Semantic Decomposition.  
The transmitter is a Google Coral Edge TPU board with a maximum of 4 TOPS (int8) computations, equipped with a  
Debian Mendel Linux system, and powered by a portable power bank. The receivers are two laptops with NVIDIA RTX 3060 and RTX 4060 GPUs.  
The real-time video input is captured by a connected webcam, and all communications are through Wi-Fi 2x2 MIMO (802.11b/g/n/ac 2.4/5GHz).  
This is a ‚Äúlive demo‚Äù with hardware/software set up at the conference venue.
